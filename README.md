## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create an online dictionary of all the different words and phrases used in Northern Ireland. Each word or phrase in the dictionary will have a definition along with an example of how the word or phrase might typically be used in conversation by locals.

The site is aimed at:

- Anyone visiting Northern Ireland for the first time
- Anyone who has visited but struggled to understand some of the words and phrases used by locals
- Anyone who has visited and was lucky enough to learn some of the words and phrases used by locals during their visit, and wants to share this with other travellers
- Anyone from Northern Ireland who wants to share some of the words and phrases they use, to help anyone visiting the country

First time visitors to the site will be able to sign up for an account so they can easily add any words or phrases to the dictionary that might be missing, as well as rate the words and phrases featured in the dictionary.
